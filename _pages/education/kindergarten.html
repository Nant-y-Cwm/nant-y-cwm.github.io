<p>Imaginative play has a very important role in a child's development and forms a major part of the kindergarten day.  We work with a strong rhythm that remains the same from day to day and week to week, season to season and year to year. The rhythm becomes deeply rooted in the children allowing them to know what the day will bring.</p>

<h3>Head, Heart and Hands</h3>

<p>Steiner education focuses on the development of the whole child, Head, Heart and Hand, in a loving environment through rhythm, repetition and reverence.</p>

<p>Nant-y-Cwm Kindergarten provides a special place for all children. Imaginative play has a very important role in a child&rsquo;s development and forms a major part of the kindergarten day.</p>

<p>We work with a strong rhythm that remains the same from day to day and week to week, season to season and year to year. The rhythm becomes deeply rooted in the children allowing them to know what the day will bring.</p>

<p>The teacher and assistant carry out the day&rsquo;s work and the children can choose to play or join the adults. Through imitation the children learn how to carry out tasks. Young and new children often stay by the teacher&rsquo;s or assistant&rsquo;s side for the majority of the day until little by little they are ready to play with the other children.</p>

<p>During our daily walks through the local woods, playing in the stream or making dens in the wild garden the children gain reverence and learn how to care for the natural world. We work with the seasons in ring time with songs, poems and movement, which are repeated for a half term and the children get to know the gestures and words to each song and verse. Stories, with rich language, are told by the teacher or a puppet show may be given</p>

<h3>The Kindergarten day has a natural rhythm</h3>

<p>Children arrive between 8.50-9.00. The children have time for imaginative play, and taking part in the tasks e.g. sewing, woodwork, making, cleaning toys, preparing food for the following day&rsquo;s snack, etc. Children are welcome, but not required, to help. As the teacher and assistant show devotion for their work they inspire the children to find happiness in their play. Tidy time brings the end of play and all the children are encouraged to be involved.</p>

<p>We then come together for ring-time, filled with seasonal songs, movement, gestures and poems; it is a time for listening. Children will participate when they are ready to do so. We are sensitive to those children who wish to be observers.</p>

<p>We wash our hands and prepare for a wholesome snack, a time for talking and sharing. A candle is lit and a blessing said to show appreciation for our food. We clear away together.</p>

<p>We put on appropriate clothes and go out for a walk in the woods, down by the stream or up the hill, or play in the garden. The teacher and assistant take on a task, which the children are welcome to take part in.</p>

<p>Story is a calm end to the morning. &nbsp;The story is normally told rather than read so that the children are free to develop their own images and feel part of the group; it sometimes takes the form of a simple puppet play. A farewell verse is said and children are taken to meet their parent/carer.</p>

<p>Some children stay for the afternoon, they rest for a short while before eating their healthy packed lunches, then more play, this can be a calm time after a busy morning.</p>

<p>Indoors: For warmth and hygiene purposes we wear slippers.</p>

<p>Outdoors: We try to go out whatever the weather so your child will need: Waterproofs, wellington boots, warm/sun hat, scarf and gloves, if cold, a change of clothes (just in case)</p>
