<p>Steiner Education is based on the philosophy of the Austrian, Dr.Rudolf Steiner (1861-1925). His study of mankind showed that during childhood and adolescence, physical, emotional and intellectual development follows a particular sequence. The curriculum of a Steiner school reflects this fundamental principle, corresponding to the inner development of the child as he or she journeys from the imaginative world of early childhood to the adult world of clear intellectual thought. Rudolf Steiner founded the first Steiner Waldorf School in Stuttgart in 1919.</p>
