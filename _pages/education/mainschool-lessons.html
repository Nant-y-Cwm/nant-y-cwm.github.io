<h3>Lessons</h3>
<h4>Painting</h4>
<p>Through the medium of watercolour the children develop a deep and intimate connection with the colours and their individual qualities. In the younger classes such colour work is entirely non-representational, yet the paintings grow quite naturally out of a story told by the teacher. In the older classes these lessons are extended to include other media such as black and white shaded drawing and perspective.</p>
<h4>Music</h4>
<p>In the early years the children learn many pentatonic songs and singing games, and learn to play by imitation the pentatonic pipe. Notation is gradually introduced, at first in a pictorial way from class 3; at this time too, the children move onto the recorder. We can supply contact details for local teachers for piano, violin, guitar and flute.</p>

<h4>Languages</h4>
<p>Steiner schools were pioneers in showing the benefits of starting a foreign language at the beginning of formal schooling. Through poems and verses combined with action and gesture, through songs, games and little plays, the child gradually develops a feeling for the soul of the language, and only later does he or she approach the written and printed word. In this way a sure foundation is laid, and the learning of grammar, which begins around Class 4, develops quite naturally &nbsp;and healthily out of the living language. We currently offer French as a language.</p>
<h4>Handwork</h4>
<p>In these lessons, that run through life at Nant-y-Cwm like a brightly coloured thread, the children&rsquo;s manual dexterity is developed as they learn a whole range of skills from knitting in Class 1 and crocheting in Class 2 to sewing cross-stitch, embroidery, felt making, frame-loom weaving and dress-making on the machine.</p>
<h4>Games</h4>
<p>In the younger classes, games are imaginative and non competitive, and a wealth of ring games, catching games and ball games are explored. As the children grow older, team games with rules are introduced, and in Class 5 the children take part in the annual Olympic Games held a Michael Hall involving 20 schools and approximately 400 children. Activities are introduced at the appropriate time to challenge the child&rsquo;s growing skills and capacities, it is also linked with the curriculum i.e. Olympics when studying Ancient Greece, precision movement when studying geometry.</p>


<h4>Gardening</h4>
<p>Coppice craft and woodwork &ndash; As with other practical work, the children&rsquo;s thinking and understanding are developed through movement, as well as gaining practical skills. In the garden, children gain a practical understanding of nature and the seasons, they take responsibility for and learn skills involved in managing the land, growing food and caring for our orchard. This is extended into coppice craft and woodwork where the woodlands provide raw materials for many uses.</p>
