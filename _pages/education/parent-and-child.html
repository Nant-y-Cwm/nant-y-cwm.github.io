<p>The parent and toddler group aims to provide a place where parents and children under three and a half can communicate through play, songs, artistic and practical activities.</p>

<h3>Peaceful Environment</h3>

<p>Our group aims to provide a peaceful environment free of pressures, where children can find the time, space and equipment for creative play. This strengthens the imagination and gives them the ability to unfold themselves. Parents might also find some stillness, support or inspiration from each other for everyday parenting. This group is based on the observation that young children learn through imitation and repetition, so use is made of imitation and example rather than instruction and direction. There are no expectations that you oblige your child to join in but that you do so yourself. Sessions have a rhythmic structure and the seasonal songs and stories are repeated for each half term, so children and parents may learn them by heart!</p>

<p>We begin each morning with bread making, encouraging the children to shape and create their own piece of bread, which is then baked in the oven, after this we clear the table ready for the seasonal craft. Play and craft activities run alongside each other for about 40 minutes. The idea is that if working parents/adults are present, children relax and are stimulated in their play. They become active and learn independently through play and &nbsp;imitation of the adults and join in the craft activity if they are ready. There will be a different craft activity each week, making something for the children or the home. Natural materials found on walks are used, such as conkers, pine cones, leaves, etc. You are welcome to bring your own craft project and share it with the group, if you wish! A tidy up song will mark the transition to snack time. We take time to lay the table and bless the food and eat the delicious bread we made earlier, children are encouraged to stay at the table during snack time but are not expected to. After sharing snack at the table we say thank you for the meal and tidy away. Once the space is cleared we are ready for ring time, where we gather to listen to a story of a little child, each week following their journey from home to the countryside and hearing about their encounters on the way with the animals and nature along their path. We will sing seasonal songs and nursery rhymes mixed in with the story. After ring time we end the morning session with a &nbsp;goodbye song.</p>

<p>Our sessions are on Tuesdays, Wednesdays and Thursdays from 10-12.45. &nbsp;Please contact the office if you are interested in joining one of our groups.</p>
