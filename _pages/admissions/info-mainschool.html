				<p>The school itself takes children from age 6 or 7 to age 14, in classes numbered 1 to 8. Because we are a small school we operate a doubled-class system; thus in one year we will have classes 1/2, 3/4, 5/6, 7/8 , and the following year we will have classes 1 2/3, 4/5, 6/7. Our experience has shown that there are numerous benefits in this system. Younger children may look up to older role-models, while the older group learns to take the responsibility of providing an example for the younger ones.</p>
