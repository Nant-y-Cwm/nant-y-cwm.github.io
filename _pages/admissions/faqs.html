<p><strong>Q: Are steiner schools religious?</strong></p>
		<p>Steiner schools work conciously out of a Christian impulse, but are wholly non denominational, and are open to all children irrespective of race, creed or colour. Parents of numerous faiths and beleifs send their children to Steiner schools and there is no attempt to interfere with the home's spiritual or religious environment.</p>
