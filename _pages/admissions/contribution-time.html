<p>Nant-y-cwm receives no state funding instead it relys solely on family contributions both financially and in time commitments.</p>

<p>When your child joins Nant-y-cwm,&nbsp; you join a whole community of people working together to help the flow of day to day life here.</p>

<p>There are many ways to support the school, from the sharing of annual festivals to cleaning. We have several teams made up of the wider school community who work to support the running of the school; the PR and publicity team, the fundraising team, the premises team(building maintenance and landscaping), the finance team, the admin team and the the school management team.</p>
<p>Our fundraising team arrange fun and exciting events. We have a well supported monthly work day at school where we care for and maintain the school environment. We painted the outside of the school pink this summer and are in the process of repainting the window frames a lovely deep wine red colour! Our craft group are busy making dolls and other beautiful handmade toys. There really are so many creative, sociable and satisfying aspects of being involved. It&rsquo;s about doing what you are good at, enjoy doing and learning new skills from each other- and ultimately, nurturing the school that nurtures our children.</p>
