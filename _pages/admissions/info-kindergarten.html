<p>Before being formally admitted to the kindergarten or school, you will be asked to complete an application form. Your child may have a trial day, and the parents then take part in an interview with the appropriate teacher. Our hope is that with this both you have a clear understanding of what we offer at Nant-y-Cwm, and that we also feel that we are able to meet your child&rsquo;s needs. We hope to be able to answer any questions you may still have, and also to discuss the financial and time contributions from families that we need to run and maintain our lovely school.</p>
				<p>The kindergarten open day will be Friday 5th October 2012 (10.30-12.30). The school&rsquo;s annual open day will be in &nbsp;May 2013. (date to be confirmed) If you are interested in coming along or would like more details then please contact the office.</p>
