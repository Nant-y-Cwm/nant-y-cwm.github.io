Nant-y-Cwm
==========

In the beautiful Preseli Hills in North West Pembrokeshire, the rolling and windswept, often misty and mysterious hills fall away to the south, to leafy green valleys with narrow lanes, to the babbling brook beginnings of the Eastern Cleddau river, and to a little Steiner school called Nant-y-cwm.
