<p>In a Steiner school, the festivals are the heartbeat of school life. They are celebrated from parent and child group through to class 8, bringing children, teachers families and the wider community together at the cardinal points of the year: Christmas, Easter, Mayday, Whitsun, St. John's Tide, Michaelmas and Martinmas are greeted like familiar friends as they return again and again, together with their songs and colourful traditions.</p>
