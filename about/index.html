<p>In the beautiful Preseli Hills in North West Pembrokeshire, the rolling and windswept, often misty and mysterious hills fall away to the south, to leafy green valleys with narrow lanes, to the babbling brook beginnings of the Eastern Cleddau river, and to a little Steiner school called Nant-y-cwm.</p>

		 	<h2>Our History</h2>
		</div>  
		<p>Nant-y-Cwm, founded in 1979 by a group of like-minded parents, is one of over 900 Steiner Waldorf Schools Ôö£├ÂÔö£├ºÔö£Ôöñ the largest independent educational movement in the world. Our warm and friendly school is located in a wooded valley beside the Eastern Cleddau river in rural Pembrokeshire Ôö£├ÂÔö£├ºÔö£Ôöñ an idyllic setting for children.</p>

		<p>We have a flourishing school community with around 50 children in the Kindergarten and Main School. We also run a thriving Family Playgroup.</p>


		<p>Our main school building was originally a small rural Victorian primary school that had lain empty for years until in 1979, a group of enthusiastic parents and friends bought it. With a lot of hard work, effort and love, they renovated it and extended it, and founded our present Steiner school, beginning with just 3 teachers and a handful of children. &nbsp;Since then 2 further wooden frame buildings and a unique, beautiful kindergarten have been added. Our kindergarten was designed by architect and parent Christopher Day, and built by parents and friends of Nant-y-cwm and it opened in 1991. &nbsp;It was designed with the young child in mind with little cosy corners, small peephole windows, soft rounded walls painted in soft colours. It has attracted many visitors, publicity and won architectural awards.</p>

		<p>The school was founded and continues to grow with the dedication and courage of many teachers and families who over the years have recognised through their children a need for a sensitive and enlightened education. Through their struggles and joys a creative and educational community has flourished. We are very proud of our lovely school, we now even have former pupil&rsquo;s children attending Nant-y-cwm, and a former pupil teaching here!</p>

		 	<h2>Festivals</h2>
		</div>
		<p>In a Steiner school, the festivals are the heartbeat of school life. They are celebrated from parent and child group through to class 8, bringing children, teachers families and the wider community together at the cardinal points of the year: Christmas, Easter, Mayday, Whitsun, St. John's Tide, Michaelmas and Martinmas are greeted like familiar friends as they return again and again, together with their songs and colourful traditions.</p>
