				<h3>Kindergarten</h3>
				<p>Before being formally admitted to the kindergarten or school, you will be asked to complete an application form. Your child may have a trial day, and the parents then take part in an interview with the appropriate teacher. Our hope is that with this both you have a clear understanding of what we offer at Nant-y-Cwm, and that we also feel that we are able to meet your child&rsquo;s needs. We hope to be able to answer any questions you may still have, and also to discuss the financial and time contributions from families that we need to run and maintain our lovely school.</p>
<p>The kindergarten open day will be Friday 5th October 2012 (10.30-12.30). The school&rsquo;s annual open day will be in &nbsp;May 2013. (date to be confirmed) If you are interested in coming along or would like more details then please contact the office.</p>

				<h3>Main School</h3>
								<p>The school itself takes children from age 6 or 7 to age 14, in classes numbered 1 to 8. Because we are a small school we operate a doubled-class system; thus in one year we will have classes 1/2, 3/4, 5/6, 7/8 , and the following year we will have classes 1 2/3, 4/5, 6/7. Our experience has shown that there are numerous benefits in this system. Younger children may look up to older role-models, while the older group learns to take the responsibility of providing an example for the younger ones.</p>

		 	<h2>F.A.Q.s</h2>
		</div> 
		<p><strong>Q: Are steiner schools religious?</strong></p>
<p>Steiner schools work conciously out of a Christian impulse, but are wholly non denominational, and are open to all children irrespective of race, creed or colour. Parents of numerous faiths and beleifs send their children to Steiner schools and there is no attempt to interfere with the home&#39;s spiritual or religious environment.</p>

	  		<h2>Time Contribution</h2>
	  	</div>
	  	<p>Nant-y-cwm receives no state funding instead it relys solely on family contributions both financially and in time commitments.</p>
<p>When your child joins Nant-y-cwm,&nbsp; you join a whole community of people working together to help the flow of day to day life here.</p>
<p>There are many ways to support the school, from the sharing of annual festivals to cleaning. We have several teams made up of the wider school community who work to support the running of the school; the PR and publicity team, the fundraising team, the premises team(building maintenance and landscaping), the finance team, the admin team and the the school management team.</p>
<p>Our fundraising team arrange fun and exciting events. We have a well supported monthly work day at school where we care for and maintain the school environment. We painted the outside of the school pink this summer and are in the process of repainting the window frames a lovely deep wine red colour! Our craft group are busy making dolls and other beautiful handmade toys. There really are so many creative, sociable and satisfying aspects of being involved. It&rsquo;s about doing what you are good at, enjoy doing and learning new skills from each other- and ultimately, nurturing the school that nurtures our children.</p>
